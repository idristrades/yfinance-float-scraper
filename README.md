# yfinance-float-scraper

This program pulls the stock price and float from Yahoo Finance in about 2 seconds.

It is meant to help traders make a faster buying decision based on 'Float', 'Price' and whatever other metric they'd like to add to those.

The next step will be to combine it with a news scraper and automate the process of checking both the float and the stock price and then send a buy order
to a brokerage account simultaneously.

After that, all the trader has to do is hit the 'buy button' to confirm the transation once the float/price meet a predefined criteria.


Make fast and informed buying decisions.
