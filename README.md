# yfinance-float-scraper

This program pulls the current price + the stock float information from Yahoo Finance in about 8 seconds.

It is meant to help day traders bring down the process of checking news and making a fast decision.

Once I bring this number down to 3 seconds or less, I will then combine it with
a news scraper I build not long ago . This will help automate the process of checking the stock information and sending a buy order
to the brokerage account simultaneously.

All the trader would need to do is to hit the buy button to confirm the transation once the float/price info is a pass.

Feel free to help with this project or use it whatever way you want.
