# yfinance-float-scraper

This program pulls the current price + float from Yahoo Finance in about 9 seconds.

It is meant to help day traders make a faster buying decision based on 'float'.

The next step will be to combine it with a news scraper and automate the process of checking both the float and the stock price and then send a buy order
to a trader's brokerage account simultaneously.

After that, all the trader has to do is hit the 'buy button' to confirm the transation once the float/price meet a predefined criteria.


Help bring this number down to 3 seconds or less.
